 I am not a gamer.  I go this primarily for its backlit keys.  I don't really understand why gamers needs such a pretty keyboard.  I think maybe some keys have special purposes for gaming and so are similarly colored.  On my keyboard for e.g. keys ASDW, up, down, left, right are colored differently from all the other keys - purple.  The number keys on the number pad are yellow, the operators red, the number keys on the main keyboard are red, the other letters turquoise(? one of those light blues) and the function keys are a bright blue, the home, ins, pg up etc. are green.  There are various effects for the lighting which I really dont get the purpose of.I like that there is an indicator for caps lock, and num lock and also a windows lock key.  Not sure what it does.There is a lot of play when pressing the keys.  You don't have to press hard but here is also space between the keys so it feels like you will press more than one key at a time but its surprisingly accurate.  The body feels good.  It sits a little high off the table surface as compared to my logitech wireless keyboard.  So I'm not happy about that.  It forces my wrists up - I like my keyboard as flat as possible.Its not particularly noisy either.  I was expecting a loud clickety-clack-clack but not really.  My other option was to get one of those membrane keyboards and I am not a fan of them.  Dont like the feel.Thankfully the lights turn of when your PC sleeps.  Otherwise I imagine this could light up a dark room.Docking a star because I cant find a mode where all the keys are lit up the same color.  Why not man?  All these weird strobing and running and flashing effects but no ability to have just one solid color.  That feature for me would have made this a 5* keyboard."
1,"I ended up giving it to my wife for 3 reasons.1) If it has a Lock for the Windows Key, I couldn't figure out the combination of buttons to push to activate it.2) Has multiple color settings but you can't pick specific colors. (I ordered this while exhausted, my fault.)3) My wife walked into the Mancave and exclaimed, ""Ooooo! That's pretty!""Much Rainbow.I really liked the magnetic wrist rest and look of the keyboard, I'm just more accustomed to certain bells and whistles this one doesn't come with.  Also have a strong aversion to bright pink and yellow. :DKeys don't feel like a Gaming Keyboard. They sit at a weird angle in that regard."
2,This keyboard has cool features and at first I liked it a lot. The volume knob and LEDs are awesome features. The LEDs are really nice and work well. They have a lot of different settings and the brightness is adjustable. That part is great. The keys are the problem. The problem is that the design of the keys is like a square as opposed to a standard beveled key. This throws your tactile sense off and you can easily hit several keys when typing fast. That makes it VERY difficult to type quickly. I work and play games on my PC and I was making a ton of mistakes using this keyboard. Using the WASD was not possible and I just had to order a different one. I will give this one to my 6 YO son who loves the LEDs. It's possible you can buy a different set of keys for this thing. It does come with a key puller. Who knows. That's my experience with this keyboard though.
3,"Everything I wanted in a mechanical keyboard. It has a slew of lighting options and splashy patterns including a completely ""off"" lighting selection. For the price is about as good as it gets. The keys are slightly stiff at first, but nothing a few hours of typing or gaming doesn't fix.My only gripe is the colors behind the keys are fixed. For example the number keys will always light up red."
4,"Second time trying a mechanical keyboard. I don't get the hype still and this wasn't the product to change my mind. It's an OK product but not really my thing.Some good things about this keyboard:- Feels like the quality is good, I believe it will last a long time. However it's hard to say because it's the first day having it.- I like the key shape, the rounded corners are nice and the keys are slightly concave from all 4 sides, but not too heavily. I tend to prefer flat keys, but these are pretty comfy.- It does have a cool aesthetic appearance. Kind of like those Retro Diners that have chrome trim everywhere.Some things I don't like:- As with all mechanical keyboards, the keys are huge in the vertical axis. I prefer doing everything with a chiclet keyboard and I will be going back to a chiclet keyboard soon, just going to leave this as a backup.- Even though these are not clicky switches, they're still pretty loud. You can hear the springs as you type and each keycap has quite a bit of ""wiggle"" so the keycaps themselves make a lot of noise when your fingers strike them.- To me, typing feels a bit awkward because the keys have a lot of travel, but the activation point is close to the top of the travel. I'd say the activation point is somewhere around 2 mm, while I believe the keys bottom out at what feels like well over 5 mm. I don't have any way to measure it but to me this is an awkward combination for typing. Also makes it quite easy to accidentally press the wrong key while typing.- The color of the lighting is set for each key, you can't change it. There are different animated ""patterns"" but each individual key only has one color that's either on or off."
5,"With this being my first gaming keyboard, I am very happy with the purchase. It has tons of settings to change the display of the light beneath the keys and is very easy to use.The keys themselves are responsive and sound great when typing. The bottom of the keyboard also has to kickstands to raise the elevation of the board. It also comes with a wrist pad that I chose not to use (easily removable) in favor of a memory foam pad.All in all very happy with my purchase!"
6,"This keyboard was ordered for my son to use for gaming. He loves the lights and different settings for how the lights work. The keyboard is responsive and works well with his games. We have not been able to get the / key to work in Roblox for chat, but think it may be an issue with his Xbox account blocking something- not sure yet. The added wrist rest is a nice feature, but he stopped using it after a couple days- nice that it is removable. We purchased a light up mousepad also so his desk is all lit up. He likes the larger keys for gaming."
7,I am not a gamer. I'm a 70-year-old writer. The lighting options aren't important to me but I do like that the keys can be backlit. The reason I got this keyboard was that it is wired so there isn't that little lag I never liked and the keystrokes aren't questionable. It just feels better - quicker and more responsive.
8,"I think it would be hard to beat a real mechanical keyboard with media keys at this price. I always had ""mechanical feel"" type cheaper gaming keyboards before but this really is different. I've gotten used to it quickly but at first it really did feel so much better for gaming and typing alike. Great purchase. There are a couple competitors, but none j believe that have the volume knob and mute. Which is really nice to have on a keyboard. Only thing I miss from a microsoft sidewinder I bought many years ago is a calculator button abov the keypad. Very user specific thing you may not care about however."
9,"I bought this for use with my Macbook Pro work laptop.  I am an accountant and Macbooks don't come with 10-key keyboards.  I enjoy bright, colorful office products, so when I found this I decided it was worth it.  I find the keyboard easy to use.  The sound is very much like an old-fashioned typewriter.  I love it.  My colleagues love it, too.  The colors are fun throughout the day, and they're not distracting.  I'd buy this again for sure.  Highly recommend."

30,"Nice brightness, and the gaming keys (wsdf) and arrow keys are a great striking magenta, they stand out well. A little getting used to, like any keyboard, but responsive and bright, and no keys off yet,  haha! Time will tell but very happy with this.6 months later and a LOT of use (Battle Royale, baby!) And it's as good as day one. Not a single lose or sloppy key, and all the light options are still perfectly functional. So impressed, seriously a great deal."
31,"This keyboard is my whole soul. I loved everything about her. From her clicky keys to her colorfulness. It was all amazing and I enjoyed gaming with her very much. Don't use it with acrylics tho, I had a bad experience there, acrylics and this board don't mix. But everything else was amazing. It's kind of hard to clean but I would still recommend it. The keys might be a little stiff at first but the more you use them the better it gets! Y'all got this hit plat this season kids!"
32,"I bought this & had it delivered with prime, was very eager to get it because I really needed a keyboard. After I ordered it, I saw a review video & it showed so many more things about the keyboard that make it worth the money. The buttons are really loud though, not that it’s bad but it’s not quiet in the slightest lmao. Colors are fantastic, patterns are super cool, and the keys feel comfortable. Took me no time to get adjusted, only thing I recommend you don’t use if you’re gaming is the wrist rest. It makes playing MMO’s at least feel disgusting, 0 grip on the space bar or CTRL/ALT with it up. Great buy tho"

 Very good keyboard for the money, multiple different color patterns when the volume knob is lit up, and you hold it down to turn it off to use as volume control. Nice sturdy metal frame and easy to use keys. My only complaint is that you can not change the colors of the keys but you get what you pay for and it is worth the money."
34,"I'm using this on Linux, and it works really well. No strange key behaviors. You can also program up to at least 2 more keyboard layouts.I don't think it was in the description, but if I had to give a gripe it would be not being able to choose which key has a certain color.There are also lots of cool patterns, altho I think most of them are for demo purposes or something else."
35,"It is pleasingly illuminated, but not blinding.  The key switches are tactile, yet not annoying to others around me.  A great investment of a few extra dollars which has turned into an invaluable whim purchase!PS -magnetically-attaching wrist rest is wonderful!  I use it, wife doesn't...but we're both happy and pain-free thus far."
36,"several keys on my  old keyboard stopped working and I needed a brightly backlit replacement. I prefer mechanical keyboards and this one fit the bill. Awesome backlight and the feel on the keys I love. Better even than my old one.the volume control/backlight control was not installed properly (rolling around in the box) on arrival but 2 seconds to reseat and works great. the different colors for keyboard and keypad are great.If you dont have the best eyesight like I do and need a back light, this is awesome."
37,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I love the function to customize the brightness and light pattern. I use it for work just to make my endless hell a little better"
38,I bought this for my wife because we just got her a computer and it ended up being so cool! The many different light shows. The buttons are easy to work with. Easy to install. I also ended up using it for my Xbox and PS.
39,Sounds amazing and kinda sensitive to the touch. That's the fun of it though because you glide over the keys with ease. It is noisy for those ASMR lovers. Fly across this beauty and get a dopamine drip...
